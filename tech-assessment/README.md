Hello you! 👋🏽

Welcome to this repository. 🤗

This is a technical assessment for the Moniepoint Women-in-Tech Frontend Engineering Internship.<br/>
This project draws inspiration from <a href='https://dribbble.com/shots/21289152-English-Learning-App-Mobile-App-UI-Design-Concept'>Capi Creative</a>.<br/>
The tech stack used is <a href='https://react.dev/'>React</a> and <a href='https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-weight'>Tailwindcss</a>. A bit of issues with the icons but at long last, I found <a href='https://heroicons.com/'>Hero Icons</a> 🤧.

Feel free to browse through, be awed, and tell me where I need to do better 😁.<br/>
Thanks! ✌🏽
<br/><br/>
P.S.: I couldn't get the exact colors right 🥴.
